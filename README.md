So you want to give something/somebody a custom sticker, nametag, whatever.
Any webcontent based on the specific parameters can be used (e.g. personal driving directions)
Sizes, shapes, colors, patterns, margins of the pieces and overall sheet can be set and dealt with, into ready-to-print PDFs

Taking into account:
- you never perfectly position your content on paper, let alone on sheets of stickers
- you have to take the color or pre-printed pattern of the sheet into account

I'd create it in SVG
